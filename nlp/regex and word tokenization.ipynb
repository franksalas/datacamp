    "KING ARTHUR: Whoa there!  [clop clop clop] \n",
    "SOLDIER #1: Halt!  Who goes there?\n",
    "ARTHUR: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: Pull the other one!\n",
    "ARTHUR: I am, ...  and this is my trusty servant Patsy.  We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.  I must speak with your lord and master.\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: What?  Ridden on a horse?\n",
    "ARTHUR: Yes!\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: You're using coconuts!\n",
    "ARTHUR: What?\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.\n",
    "ARTHUR: So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: Where'd you get the coconuts?\n",
    "ARTHUR: We found them.\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!\n",
    "ARTHUR: What do you mean?\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: Well, this is a temperate zone.\n",
    "ARTHUR: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?\n",
    "ARTHUR: Not at all.  They could be carried.\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: What?  A swallow carrying a coconut?\n",
    "ARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.\n",
    "ARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: Listen.  In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?\n",
    "ARTHUR: Please!\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: Am I right?\n",
    "ARTHUR: I'm not interested!\n",
    "SOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow.  That's my point.\n",
    "SOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that.\n",
    "ARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: But then of course a-- African swallows are non-migratory.\n",
    "SOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah...\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...  [clop clop clop] \n",
    "SOLDIER #2: Wait a minute!  Supposing two swallows carried it together?\n",
    "SOLDIER #1: No, they'd have to have it on a line.\n",
    "SOLDIER #2: Well, simple!  They'd just use a strand of creeper!\n",

Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em.  It sank into the swamp.  So, I built a second one.  That sank into the swamp.  So I built a third one.  That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp.  But the fourth one...  stayed up!  And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands.\n",
